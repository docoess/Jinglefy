# Jinglefy

### A Spotify clone made by [Azad Celik], [Derek Slayton], [Donald Roessler], and [Elliot Starr].

#### Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for Albums and Playlists, with Create, Read, and Delete functionality for Songs and Likes.
This is a fullstack application developed as part of App Academy's 24 week software engineering bootcamp. We initially decided on a Spotify clone because none of us were too familiar with AWS, or creating a frontend experience that could incorporate sound. As we created this project, we stumbled into a sort of 80's style retro vibe that we really enjoyed, and decided to run with it. Our frontend components and color scheme really push that theme with bright neon colors, and a fun energetic feeling. Jinglefy was initially constructed in just 1 week, but since graduating the four of us have continued to add several changes, updates, bugfixes, and features.
