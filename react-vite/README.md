# React/Vite Authenticate Me

This is the frontend for the Flask/React project. Note that it has no styling
applied. You can copy the __.css__ files from your Authenticate Me project into
the corresponding locations in the __react-vite__ folder to give your project a
unique look.

To run it:

1. `cd` into the __react-vite__ folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Launch it with `npm run dev`.
4. In your browser, navigate to [`localhost:5173`].

Don't forget to run `npm run build` before merging your work to your production
branch!

[`localhost:5173`]: http://localhost:5173/
